 * Include Makefiles to make
  + dist (release)
  + agent-pkg (tarball to install an alff-agent)
  + install-rulegen
  + install-agent

 * New Alff mode 'host' for simple host security.
  + Update alff setupPlugins to read 'fw_type'
  ~ Maybe it would be way more usefull to give a complete network topology
    to alff and let it build rulesets for firewalls and hosts based on this.

 * Add munin-like autoconf option to plugins.

 * Write the 'Alff:Ruler' which will read the output of all plugins and
   create an iptables-save like format.
   + This adds an easy possibility to remove unreferenced chains
   (see branch 'alff_ruler')

 * Add extra granularity for allow_icmp option.

 * Fiddle around with tcp_pre_analysis and improve scan detection/prevention

 * addService:
  + Write README to explain, why to use DNS instead of NSS for hostname lookups

 * alff-cat:
  + Add TRAP to handle problems and restore old ruleset.

 * alff.conf:
  + Add information about routes for networks behind a router
  + Think about possibility to generate network/interfaces from alff.conf
