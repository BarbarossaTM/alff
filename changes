Changes between v0.0.3 and v0.0.4:

 * Remove 'default_chain_policy' and defined new option 'default_chain_target'
   for plugin 'classifyInterVlanTraffic' instead to avoid confusion.
 * Renamed plugin 'accept_established_connections' to
   'accept_established_connections_' to show intended usage by plugin name.
 * Began to add new fw_type 'host' for securitng a single host.
 * Added 'alff setupPlugins' to help you with the initial alff setup.
 * Implemented new concept of 'config spaces' which allow the management of
   multiple firewalls from one client machine.
