Changes between v0.0.3 and v0.0.4:

 * Remove 'default_chain_policy' and defined new plugin option 'default_chain_target'
   for 'classifyInterVlanTraffic' instead to avoid confusion.
 * Renamed plugin 'accept_established_connections' to 'accept_established_connections_'
   to show intended usage directly by looking at the plugin name.
 * Began to add new fw_type 'host' for securitng a single host.
 * Added 'alff setupPlugins' to help you with the initial alff setup.
 *
