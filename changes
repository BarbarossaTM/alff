Changes between v0.0.4 and v0.0.5:
 * Renamed plugins to enforce naming convention:
  + drop_spoofed_packets -> drop_spoofed_packets_
 * 'alff setupPlugins' does work now.
 * Updated some plugins to fix some more previously unhandled cases.
 * Pushed plugin execution into a built-in routine
 * Added plugin 'clear_table_' which will "iptables -F, -X, -Z" a given table.
 * Fixed bug in enable_DHCP_relay_FORWARD to allow the DHCP server to answer
   DHCP requests

Changes between v0.0.3 and v0.0.4:

 * Remove 'default_chain_policy' and defined new option 'default_chain_target'
   for plugin 'classifyInterVlanTraffic' instead to avoid confusion.
 * Renamed plugin 'accept_established_connections' to
   'accept_established_connections_' to show intended usage by plugin name.
 * Began to add new fw_type 'host' for securitng a single host.
 * Added 'alff setupPlugins' to help you with the initial alff setup.
 * Implemented new concept of 'config spaces' which allow the management of
   multiple firewalls from one client machine.
    If you are upgrading from an ealier version of alff, you need to move
    your configuration from /etc/alff/ to /etc/alff/default/ if you only want
    to manage one configuration on this machine. Of course you name the
    config space for your configuration as you like, but "default" will
    be used without mentioning it to alff :)
