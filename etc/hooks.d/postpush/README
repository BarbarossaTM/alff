Place scripts in this file, which should be executed after alff has
sucessfully pushed your ruleset to your firewall maschines.

All which with executable rigths will be run.
Files without executable bits set, will not be run.

Hooks can be called before all sites and per site.
Therefore the hooks for e.g. pregenerate must resist in   
<alff-config-dir>/hooks.d/pregenerate/[ ALL | <site> ]

Hooks must end with an exitcode. Hooks ending with exitcode != 0
cause the rule generation to abort. STDOUT is given on success, STDERR
will be displayed on termination with exitcode != 0.
