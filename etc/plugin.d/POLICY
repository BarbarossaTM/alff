Some thoughts about the usage of the alff plugin.d mechanism:


00:		Flush all chains and set the default policy to DROP


01 .. 09:	Create some basic chains you would like to use later on 
		(e.g. log_and_reject, dont_log, blacklist, whitelist, ...)


10 .. 29:	Configure your INPUT chain

11:		Hook in the blacklist chain (if you need this here...)

12 .. 14:	Check for spoofed connections, port scans, bad tcp headers...


20 .. 29:	(Here you should make sure that you can access your firewall
		 again as soon as these rules are loaded. The goal of this
		 "early bird" configuration is to minimize the breakdown
		 of any (adminstrative) connection to your firewall)


30		Begin to set up the FORWARD chain and do other nifty things
		you would like.
		(A well configurated INPUT chain is asumed.)


31:		Hook in the blacklist/whitelist chain
		(If someone is blacklisted, whitelisting does not matter...)

32 .. 34:	Check for spoofed connections, port scans, bad tcp headers...


50:		Hook in connection tracking
		(accept ESTABLISHED and RELATED connections)

51 .. 55:	Service handling


75:		Create and hook in interVlanChains and load rules defined in
		rules.d/ for these chains. (If no rules are specified, place
		${DEFAULT_CHAIN_POLICY} into the chain.


99:		"Close" all chains with a LOG and REJECT target
