This directory contains configuration files for the classifyInterVlanTraffic
plugin, to setup the generated chains of network transitions.

The filenames must have the format $SOURCEVLAN_to_$DESTINATION_VLAN,
e.g. "1_to_2".

They have to contain valid iptables rules to be loaded into the chains
after they have been created.

To simplify your life[tm] alff provides a simple defaulting mechanism for the
case of having the same ruleset for multipl/eall network transitions from or
to one vlan.
Imagin having one adminisitrave network (e.g. vlan 42) and you would to allow
your admins to do everything they like in any network. Just create a
'42_to_default' file and insert one rule which just ACCEPTs all traffic:
'iptables -A 42_to_default -j ACCEPT'

Alff will take care of renaming the 'default' string to the correct value of
the current network transition.

The files will be read in the following order (if they exist.):

 1. $SourceVlan_to_default
 2. default_to_$DestinationVlan
 3. $SourceVlan_to_$DestinationVlan
 If none of the above exists the 'default_chain_policy' from allf.conf will be
 used.

This order was choosen to provide the flexibilty to use the defaulting
mechanism *and* specify special rules for one or more exact network
transitions. Your also have the possibiliy to exclude one or more network
transitions from the defaulting mechanism by just flushing all the rules in
this chain.
