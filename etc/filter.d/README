The alff filter interface provides you with the possibility to "filter" your
firewall rules before pushing them on a maschine.

This maybe usefull or needed if you have different hardware / interface names
/ you-name-it in your firewall which should basicly get the same ruleset.

If you would like to filter your ruleset before it get's pushed to a maschine,
just place an executable script into /etc/alff/filter.d which is named like
the machine id of the machine it should be use for. This script has to read
the ruleset from stdin and has to write the modified/fitered ruleset to
stdout.

It is possible to use on script for multiple machines, but just using
symlinks.
